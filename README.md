Commodore 64 Projects
------------
----------
The Commodore 64 shaped the computing industry and created some of the greatest programmers out there.

With capabilities years ahead of its time(1982) and a still [very active demoscene](http://csdb.dk/) i crave to learn more
about this machiene. Are **you** keeping up with the Commodore? This repository will not see a lot of assembly code, but it will feature classic CBM BASIC 2 code and modern CC65 C code.
Why am i doing this? Because the machiene is facinating, the community is nice, and it makes me a better programmer.
